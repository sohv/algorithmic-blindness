Here is the reasoning summary:

NOTEARS is fundamentally designed for continuous optimization over directed acyclic graphs, typically assuming linear relationships with Gaussian noise or specific non-linear functional forms. The Hepar2 dataset, however, consists of discrete (categorical) variables, which violates the core continuous assumption of standard NOTEARS. While the sample size of 1000 is moderate, the high dimensionality (70 nodes) and sparsity (120 edges) combined with the discrete nature of the data will likely cause NOTEARS to struggle significantly, often treating discrete values as ordinal or continuous, leading to poor structure recovery compared to algorithms designed for discrete data (like PC or discrete-score-based search). Consequently, the expected performance will be low, characterized by low recall and potentially high structural Hamming distance.
