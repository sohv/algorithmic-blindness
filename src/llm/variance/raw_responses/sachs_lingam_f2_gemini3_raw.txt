Here is the high-level reasoning for the predicted performance:

LiNGAM relies on the assumption that the data generating process is linear and that the error terms are non-Gaussian. The Sachs dataset consists of protein signaling networks measured via flow cytometry, which often exhibit non-linear biological relationships, violating the strict linearity assumption. However, the non-Gaussianity of the biological data is generally a good fit for LiNGAM. While the sample size is sufficient for a small network, the violation of linearity typically results in moderate performance, often leading to a higher number of false positives or missed edges compared to non-linear methods.
