Here is the reasoning summary:

NOTEARS formulates structure learning as a continuous optimization problem over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Its core assumption is that the data follows a linear structural equation model (SEM) with additive noise, typically Gaussian, although it can handle some non-Gaussian cases. The algorithm requires continuous data and assumes acyclicity in the true graph.

The "Synthetic_12" dataset, with 1000 samples and continuous data, aligns well with NOTEARS' requirements. The sample size is generous for a 12-variable system (n >> d), which usually ensures the optimization landscape is well-behaved and the global minimum corresponds to the true DAG. The "Small" complexity suggests a sparse graph, which NOTEARS handles effectively through L1 regularization.

Given the high sample-to-variable ratio and low complexity, NOTEARS is expected to perform very reliably. The optimization should converge to a solution close to the ground truth. Consequently, Precision and Recall are likely to be high, and the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) should be low.

Precision: [0.85, 0.95]
Recall: [0.90, 1.00]
F1: [0.88, 0.97]
SHD: [0, 2]
