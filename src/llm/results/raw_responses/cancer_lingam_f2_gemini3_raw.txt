Here is the reasoning summary:

LINGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) fundamentally assumes that the data generating process is linear and that the error terms are non-Gaussian and continuous. The Cancer dataset, however, consists of discrete data, which violates the core assumption of continuous variables required by standard LINGAM implementations (like ICA-LINGAM or DirectLINGAM). While the sample size is sufficient for a small network, the fundamental mismatch between the discrete nature of the data and the algorithm's continuous mathematical foundation typically leads to poor structure learning performance, often resulting in near-random or very low accuracy. Consequently, the expected performance metrics will be low, reflecting the algorithm's inability to correctly identify causal directions or adjacencies in discrete data.
