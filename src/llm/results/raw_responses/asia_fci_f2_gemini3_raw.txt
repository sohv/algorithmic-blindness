Here is the reasoning summary:

The FCI (Fast Causal Inference) algorithm is designed for causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders and selection bias. Its core assumption is the faithfulness of the distribution to the underlying causal graph, alongside the Causal Markov assumption. The Asia dataset, being a small, discrete network with 8 variables and 8 edges, generally satisfies these structural assumptions. However, with only 1000 samples, the conditional independence tests (typically G-square or Chi-square for discrete data) may lack statistical power, particularly for higher-order conditioning sets, which can lead to errors in skeleton identification and orientation. While the small graph size mitigates the computational complexity, the sample size is a limiting factor for perfect recovery, likely resulting in moderate precision and recall, with some spurious or missing edges (SHD).

Precision: [0.60, 0.75]
Recall: [0.50, 0.70]
F1: [0.55, 0.70]
SHD: [4, 8]
