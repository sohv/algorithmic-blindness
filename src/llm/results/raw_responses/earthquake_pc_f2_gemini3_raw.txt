Based on the analysis of the PC algorithm's assumptions (Causal Markov, Faithfulness) and the specific characteristics of the Earthquake dataset (small network, sufficient sample size for discrete data, low complexity), the algorithm is expected to perform very well. The sample size of 1000 is robust for a 5-node network, minimizing Type II errors in conditional independence testing.
