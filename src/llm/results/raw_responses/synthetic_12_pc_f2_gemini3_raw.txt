The reasoning process involves evaluating the PC algorithm's suitability for the "Synthetic_12" dataset.

1.  **PC Assumptions:** The PC algorithm assumes Causal Sufficiency (no latent confounders), the Causal Markov Condition, and Faithfulness. It relies on conditional independence tests (typically Fisher's z-transform for continuous Gaussian data).
2.  **Dataset Fit:** With 1000 samples and only 12 variables, the sample size is quite generous (approx. 83 samples per variable). This is generally sufficient for the conditional independence tests to have reasonable power, assuming the relationships are linear and Gaussian. The "Small" complexity suggests a sparse graph, which PC handles well.
3.  **Complexity Impact:** Low complexity (sparsity) is ideal for PC, as it reduces the number of high-order conditional independence tests required, minimizing error propagation.
4.  **Performance Estimation:** Given the high sample-to-variable ratio and low complexity, PC is expected to perform well. Precision should be high due to the conservative nature of the tests with sufficient data. Recall should also be decent, though PC can sometimes be overly aggressive in removing edges if the alpha value isn't tuned or if correlations are weak. SHD should be relatively low.
