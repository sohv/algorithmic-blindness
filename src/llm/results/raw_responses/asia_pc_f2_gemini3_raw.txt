Here is the reasoning summary:

The PC algorithm assumes causal sufficiency, the Causal Markov condition, and Faithfulness. The Asia dataset, being a small, discrete Bayesian network with 8 nodes and 8 edges, generally satisfies these structural assumptions well. With 1000 samples, the sample size is sufficient for reliable conditional independence testing (using G-square or Chi-square) given the low dimensionality, though some weak dependencies might still be missed. The low complexity (sparse graph) significantly boosts PC's reliability, making it likely to recover the skeleton accurately, though orientation errors (v-structures) are common. Consequently, performance is expected to be high, with strong precision and recall, and a low Structural Hamming Distance (SHD).

Precision: [0.75, 0.90]
Recall: [0.70, 0.85]
F1: [0.75, 0.85]
SHD: [2, 5]
