THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Explanatory Factor: Graph Complexity (Sparsity/Density)
  This factor explains ~72% of performance variation,
  suggesting it is the primary driver of algorithm behavior in this domain.

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm performance in causal discovery is determined by a combination of
problem structure (graph complexity), data characteristics (sample size,
dimensionality), and algorithm-specific sensitivities to these factors.
This analysis provides theoretical grounding for understanding performance variation
and can guide future algorithm development and selection strategies.
