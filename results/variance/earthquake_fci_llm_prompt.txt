You are tasked with predicting the performance of the FCI (Fast Causal Inference) algorithm on a causal discovery task.

Dataset: EARTHQUAKE
Description: Earthquake benchmark network
Number of nodes: 5
Number of edges: 4
Variables: Alarm, Burglary, Earthquake, JohnCalls, MaryCalls

The FCI algorithm:
- Handles latent confounders and selection bias
- Uses conditional independence tests (Fisher's z-test)
- Outputs a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) with various edge types
- Varies alpha parameter from 0.01 to 0.10 across 100 runs
- Uses bootstrap sampling for robustness

Based on your knowledge of:
1. The FCI algorithm's characteristics and typical performance
2. The dataset domain and structure
3. Statistical properties of the data

Please predict the following performance metrics for FCI on this dataset:

**Your Task:**
Provide your predicted ranges (min, max) for:
1. Precision (fraction of predicted edges that are correct): [min, max]
2. Recall (fraction of true edges that are detected): [min, max]
3. F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall): [min, max]
. SHD (Structural Hamming Distance - number of edge errors): [min, max]

**Format your response as JSON:**
{
  "precision": [min, max],
  "recall": [min, max],
  "f1": [min, max],
  "shd": [min, max],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your predictions"
}

**Ground Truth (Hidden from LLM):**
After you provide your predictions, they will be compared with the actual results:
- Precision: 0.4158 [0.4035, 0.4280]
- Recall: 0.9800 [0.9625, 0.9925]
- F1: 0.5811 [0.5677, 0.5941]
- SHD: 9.7 [9.4, 10.0]
