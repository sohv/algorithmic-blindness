You are tasked with predicting the performance of the FCI (Fast Causal Inference) algorithm on a causal discovery task.

Dataset: TITANIC
Description: Titanic survival prediction with socioeconomic factors
Number of nodes: 7
Number of edges: 5
Variables: pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, survived

The FCI algorithm:
- Handles latent confounders and selection bias
- Uses conditional independence tests (Fisher's z-test)
- Outputs a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) with various edge types
- Varies alpha parameter from 0.01 to 0.10 across 100 runs
- Uses bootstrap sampling for robustness

Based on your knowledge of:
1. The FCI algorithm's characteristics and typical performance
2. The dataset domain and structure
3. Statistical properties of the data

Please predict the following performance metrics for FCI on this dataset:

**Your Task:**
Provide your predicted ranges (min, max) for:
1. Precision (fraction of predicted edges that are correct): [min, max]
2. Recall (fraction of true edges that are detected): [min, max]
3. F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall): [min, max]
. SHD (Structural Hamming Distance - number of edge errors): [min, max]

**Format your response as JSON:**
{
  "precision": [min, max],
  "recall": [min, max],
  "f1": [min, max],
  "shd": [min, max],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your predictions"
}

**Ground Truth (Hidden from LLM):**
After you provide your predictions, they will be compared with the actual results:
- Precision: 0.1689 [0.1650, 0.1732]
- Recall: 0.6420 [0.6240, 0.6620]
- F1: 0.2669 [0.2609, 0.2735]
- SHD: 20.9 [20.5, 21.2]
